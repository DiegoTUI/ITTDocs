    This operation registers an existing user by adding the phone number to its record. It receives the phone number along with optional name, surname and e-mail of the user. It does a number of checks in order to make sure that the user exists and the tuple (phoneNr, appId) is unique, and then registers the user in the system. It returns an empty response or an error if anything went wrong.
