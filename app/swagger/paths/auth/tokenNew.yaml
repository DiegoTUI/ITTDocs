  summary: Produces a new token and anonymous user.
  description: >
    This operation produces and returns a new token and a new anonymous user for a certain app, **and should only be called the first time the user opens the app** (in case you are using our user management system). The app will have to provide its credentials (`apiKey` and `apiSecret`) in order to obtain a new token. The token is required as authentication by the **booking** operations. This operation also returns a `userId` identifying a newly created anonymous user. This `userId` will be user for **registering the user** and for **renewing the token**.
