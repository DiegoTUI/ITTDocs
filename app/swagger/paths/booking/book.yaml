  summary: Books one of the vehicles returned by the avail operation.
  description: >
    This operation books one of the vehicles returned by a valid avail request, identified by the `id` field returned in the response of the avail operation. The only compulsory fields of the body of this request are `id` and `payment`. However most of the vehicles will require extra information such as `customer.name` or `customer.phone`. This information is returned by the avail operation in the `requiredForBooking` field. Otherwise the request will fail.
