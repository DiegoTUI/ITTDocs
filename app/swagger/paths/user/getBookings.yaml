  summary: Lists the bookings of the user specified by the token.
  description: >
    This operation lists the **finished** and **pending** bookings of the user specified by the token. A booking is considered **finished** when the interaction customer-driver is over. This includes succesful rides, cancellations, passenger no shows and driver no shows. A booking is considered **pending** when it is confirmed, but it has not already happened (that is, prebooks). All pending bookings will have their `status` set to `confirmed`, and a `date` not `null` and set in the future.
